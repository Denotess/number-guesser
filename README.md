# Number Guesser

A small Go command-line game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number.

## Clone

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd number-guesser
```

## Commands

```bash
go run main.go
```

## How It Works

- The program picks a random number when it starts.
- You enter guesses in the terminal.
- After each guess, it tells you if the guess is too high or too low.
- The game ends when you guess the number.

## Run

```bash
go run .
```
